	Hello my name is Pascal,
	
the reason i like technology is because it helps do cool things. though i am not good at it right now i know that practice will make me better.
technology will help me understand the way thing work. today in our world things happen that i believe with technology we can figure out 
the problem and then the solution and i want to be part of this whole process.
